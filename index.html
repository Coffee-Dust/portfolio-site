        <h4>Personal Info</h4>
        <p>Hi! I'm Jonathan Dust, otherwise known as CoffeeDust. Personally I've always enjoyed programming. I started out with learning a little bit of lua. Didn't go to well for me at that time so I decided to take a break. Then I got into programming with iOS and Objective-C. That was not too fun for me then. I pretty much gave up on programming for a while, then my high school(Penn Foster Online) offered programming as my electives. That caught my attention so I decided to go with it. By the time I got to my electives I really enjoyed what I was learning even though they were just teaching me psuedocode. I learned a lot of things that I never could get the hang of then. </p>
        <h4>The 8-bit Master</h4>
        <p>At that point I heard Apple released a new easy to understand language called Swift. I came up with a game idea and put it into action. Several hundred forums later and about 6 months, my game was complete. Although it never really took off, it was good programming experience for me. That's when I decided to look for a coding school that would fit my needs.</p>
        <h4>Flatiron School</h4>
        <p>Somewhat disapointed my game did not take off,</p>
